 Rationale To Decisions I made during development

- Due to the fact that middyfy does not have full typescript support despite it is t]an inbuilt middleware for serverless applications, I used a very popular validator called yup which has full support for typescript.


- I also decided to create an utility for sending http response back to the client to avoid code duplication.

- During development also, I seperated the services from the handlers so as to ensure every component of the app is a unit.
